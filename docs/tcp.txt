	Some less-widely known details of TCP connections.

	Properly closing the connection.

After this code sequence:

    sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    connect(sock, &remote, sizeof(remote));
    write(sock, buffer, 1000000);

a large block of data is only buffered by kernel, it can't be sent all at once.
What will happen if we close the socket?

"A host MAY implement a 'half-duplex' TCP close sequence, so that
 an application that has called close() cannot continue to read
 data from the connection. If such a host issues a close() call
 while received data is still pending in TCP, or if new data is
 received after close() is called, its TCP SHOULD send a RST
 to show that data was lost."

IOW: if we just close(sock) now, kernel can reset the TCP connection,
discarding some not-yet sent data.

What can be done about it?

Solution #1: block until sending is done:

    /* When enabled, a close(2) or shutdown(2) will not return until
     * all queued messages for the socket have been successfully sent
     * or the linger timeout has been reached.
     */
    struct linger {
	int l_onoff;    /* linger active */
    	int l_linger;   /* how many seconds to linger for */
    } linger;
    linger.l_onoff = 1;
    linger.l_linger = SOME_NUM;
    setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, &linger, sizeof(linger));
    close(sock);

Solution #2: tell kernel that you are done sending.
This makes kernel send FIN, not RST:

    shutdown(sock, SHUT_WR);
    close(sock);


	Defeating Nagle.

Method #1: manually control whether partial sends are allowed:

This prevents partially filled packets being sent:

    int state = 1;
    setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_CORK, &state, sizeof(state));

and this forces last, partially filled packet (if any) to be sent:

    int state = 0;
    setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_CORK, &state, sizeof(state));

Method #2: make any write to immediately send data, even if it's partial:

    int state = 1;
    setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, &state, sizeof(state));
