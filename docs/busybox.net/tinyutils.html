<h3>External Tiny Utilities</h3>

This is a list of tiny utilities whose functionality is not provided by
busybox.  If you have additional suggestions, please send an e-mail to our
dev mailing list.

<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
 <th>Feature</th>
 <th>Utilities</th>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>SSH</td>
 <td><a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/">Dropbear</a> has both an ssh server and an ssh client that together come in around 100k.  It has no external
dependencies (I.E. it does not depend on OpenSSL, using a built-in copy of
LibTomCrypt instead).  It's actively maintained, with a quiet but responsive
mailing list.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>SMTP</td>
 <td><a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/ssmtp/">ssmtp</a> is an extremely simple Mail Transfer Agent.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ntp</td>
  <td><a href="http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/">ntpclient</a> is a
tiny ntp client.  BusyBox has rdate to set the date from a remote server, but
if you want a daemon to repeatedly adjust the clock over time, try that.</td>
</table>

<p>In a gui environment, you'll probably want a web browser.
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/embedded/">Konqueror Embedded</a> requires QT
(or QT Embedded), but not KDE.  The <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo</a>
requires GTK+, but not Gnome.  Or you can try the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">graphical
version of links</a>.</p>

<h3>SCRIPTING LANGUAGES</h3>
<p>Although busybox has built-in support for shell scripts, plenty of other
small scripting languages are available on the net.  A few examples:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>language</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol5_3/tpj0503-0003.html">microperl</a> </td>
<td> A small standalone perl interpreter that can be built from the perl source
s via "make -f Makefile.micro".  If you really feel the need for perl on an embe
dded system, this is where to start.
</tr>
<tr>

<td><a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/">Lua</a></td>
<td>If you just want a small embedded scripting language to write <em>new</em>
code in, this Brazilian import is lightweight, fairly popular, and has
a complete book about it online.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.star.le.ac.uk/%7Etjg/rc/">rc</a></td>
<td>The PLAN9 shell.  Not compatible with conventional bourne shell syntax,
but fairly lightweight and small.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.forth.org/">forth</a></td>
<td>A well known language for fast and small programs, decades old but still
in use for everything from OpenBIOS to computer controlled engine timing.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For more information, you probably want to look at
<a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a> and
<a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/TinyGentoo">TinyGentoo</a>, which
build and use tiny utilities for all sorts of things.</p>
