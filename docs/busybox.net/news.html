  <li><b>10 December 2003 -- BusyBox 1.0.0-pre4 released</b><p> 

    Here goes the fourth pre-release for the new BusyBox stable
    series.  This release includes major rework to sed, lots of
    rework on tar, a new tiny implementation of bunzip2, a new
    devfsd applet, support for 2.6.x kernel modules, updates to
    the ash shell, sha1sum and md5sum have been merged into a
    common applet, the dpkg applets has been cleaned up, and tons
    of random bugs have been fixed.  Thanks everyone for all the
    testing, bug reports, and patches!  Once again, a big
    thank-you goes to Glenn McGrath (bug1) for stepping in and 
    helping get patches merged!

    <p>

    And of course, if you are reading this, you might have noticed
    the busybox website has been completely reworked.  Hopefully
    things are now somewhat easier to navigate...  If you see any
    problems, of have suggestions to make, as always, please feel
    free to send an email to the busybox mailing list.

    <p>

    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">changelog</a> has all 
    the details.  And as usual you can

    <p>Have Fun!

  <li><b>12 Sept 2003 -- BusyBox 1.0.0-pre3 released</b><p> 

    Here goes the third pre-release for the new BusyBox stable
    series.  The last prerelease has held up quite well under
    testing, but a number of problems have turned up as the number
    of people using it has increased.  Thanks everyone for all
    the testing, bug reports, and patches!

    <p>
    
    If you have submitted a patch or a bug report to the busybox
    mailing list and no one has emailed you explaining why your
    patch was rejected, it is safe to say that your patch has
    somehow gotten lost or forgotten.  That happens sometimes.
    Please re-submit your patch or bug report to the BusyBox
    mailing list!

    <p>

    The point of the "-preX" versions is to get a larger group of
    people and vendors testing, so any problems that turn up can be
    fixed prior to the final 1.0.0 release.  The main feature
    (besides additional testing) that is still still on the TODO
    list before the final BusyBox 1.0.0 release is sorting out the
    modutils issues.  For the new 2.6.x kernels, we already have
    patches adding insmod and rmmod support and those need to be
    integrated.  For 2.4.x kernels, for which busybox only supports
    a limited number of architectures, we may want to invest a bit
    more work before we cut 1.0.0.  Or we may just leave 2.4.x
    module loading alone.

    <p>

    I had hoped this release would be out a month ago.  And of
    course, it wasn't since Erik became busy getting a release of 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> 
    out the door.  Many thanks to Glenn McGrath (bug1) for
    stepping in and helping get a bunch of patches merged!  I am
    not even going to state a date for releasing BusyBox 1.0.0
    -pre4 (or the final 1.0.0).  We're aiming for late September...
    But if this release proves as to be exceptionally stable (or
    exceptionally unstable!), the next release may be very soon
    indeed.

    <li><b>30 July 2003 -- BusyBox 1.0.0-pre2 released</b><p> 

    Here goes another pre release for the new BusyBox stable
    series.  The last prerelease (pre1) was given quite a lot of
    testing (thanks everyone!) which has helped turn up a number of
    bugs, and these problems have now been fixed.

    <p>

    Highlights of -pre2 include updating the 'ash' shell to sync up
    with the Debian 'dash' shell, a new 'hdparm' applet was added,
    init again supports pivot_root,  The 'reboot' 'halt' and
    'poweroff' applets can now be used without using busybox init.
    an ifconfig buffer overflow was fixed, losetup now allows
    read-write loop devices, uClinux daemon support was added, the
    'watchdog', 'fdisk', and 'kill' applets were rewritten, there were
    tons of doc updates, and there were many other bugs fixed.
    <p>

    If you have submitted a patch and it is not included in this
    release and Erik has not emailed you explaining why your patch
    was rejected, it is safe to say that he has lost your patch.
    That happens sometimes.   Please re-submit your patch to the
    BusyBox mailing list.
    <p>

    The point of the "-preX" versions is to get a larger group of
    people and vendors testing, so any problems that turn up can be
    fixed prior to the final 1.0.0 release.  The main feature that
    is still still on the TODO list before the final BusyBox 1.0.0
    release is adding module support for the new 2.6.x kernels.  If
    necessary, a -pre3 BusyBox release will happen on August 6th.
    Hopefully (i.e.  unless some horrible catastrophic problem
	    turns up) the final BusyBox 1.0.0 release will be ready by
    then...
