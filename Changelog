	* usage() now printf the BusyBox version.  This will help folks
	    realize that they are not in Kansas anymore.
	* Fixed mkdir -m option so that it works.
	* kill segfaulted w/o any arguments.  Now it doesn't do that.
	* kill wasn't properly accepting signal names.  It does now.
	* Added new apps chvt and deallocvt
	* Major adjustment of init.c.  Code is now readable IMHO,
	    and much more solid.

	* I added a changelog for version 0.30. 
	* adjusted find internals to make it smaller, and removed 
	    some redundancy.
	* Fixed a segfault in ps when /etc/passwd or /etc/group 
	    are absent.  Now will warn you and carry on.
	* Added in optional _real_ regular expression support (to be
	    the basis for a future sed utility).  When compiled in
	    it adds 3.9k, but makes grep much more capable.
	* Checked out using nftw(3) for recursive stuff, but unfortunatly
	    it wasn't supported before GNU libc 2.1, and some folks use
	    glibc 2.0.7 since it is much smaller than that latest and greatest.

	Major changes -- lots of stuff rewritten. Many thanks to Lineo for
	paying me to make these updates. If you have any problems with busybox, 
	or notice any bugs -- please let me know so I can fix it.  These 
	changes include:

	Core Changes:
	    * busybox can now invoke apps in two ways: via symlinks to the
		busybox binary, and as 'busybox [function] [arguments]...'
	    * When invoked as busybox, the list of currently compiled in 
		functions is printed out (no this is not bloat -- the list
		has to be there anyway to map invocation name to function).
	    * busybox no longer parses command lines for apps or displays their
		usage info.  Each app gets to handle (or not handle) this for
		itself.
	    * Eliminated monadic, dyadic, descend, block_device, and 
		postprocess.  It was cumbersome to have so many programs
		cobbled together in this way.  Without them, the app is much
		more granular.
	    * All shared code now lives in utility.c, and is properly
		ifdef'ed to be only included for those apps requiring it.
	    * Eliminated struct FileInfo (the basis of monadic, dyadic, etc)
		so now each app has the function prototype of (da-dum):
		    extern int foo_main(int argc, char** argv);
		which speeds integration of new apps.
	    * Adjusted the Makefile to make it easier to 
		{en|dis}able debugging.
	    * Changed default compiler optimization to -Os 
		(optimize for smaller binaries).

	App Changes:
	    * To cope with the new app function prototype and the removal of
		monadic, dyadic, etc, the following apps were re-written:
		    * cat - Works same as always.
		    * chgrp, chmod, chown - rewrite.  Combined into a single 
			source file.  Absorbed patches from Enrique Zanardi <ezanard@debian.org>
			that removes the dependency on libc6 libnss* libraries.
		    * cp - Can now do 'cp -a' can can copy devices,
			pipes, symlinks, as well as recursive or non-recursive dir copies.
		    * fdflush - adjusted to remove dependancy on struct FileInfo.
		    * find - Now includes some basic regexp matching 
			which will be the basic of a future mini-sed.
		    * ln - Same functionality.
		    * mkdir - Added -p flag to feature set.
		    * mv - rewrite.
		    * rm - Added -f flag to feature set.
		    * rmdir - Same functionality.
		    * swapon, swapoff - Combined into a single binary. No longer
			uses /etc/swaps.  swap{on|off} -a uses /etc/fstab instead.
		    * touch - Same functionality.
	    * date - adjusted with a patch from Matthew Grant <grantma@anathoth.gen.nz>
		to accomodate glibc timezone support.  I then ripped out GNU getopt.
	    * mkswap -- new version merged from util-linux.  Can now make >128Meg swaps.
	    * Replaced the old and star, unstar, and tarcat with the tar 
		implementation from sash.   Now tar behaves as god intended
		it to (i.e. tar -xvf <file> and tar -cf <file> <dir> work).
	    * dd -- rewritten.  Can with with files, stdin, stdout.
	    * Added the following new apps:
		    * loadfont -- added from debian boot floppies 
		    * chroot -- added based on a patch from Paolo Molaro <lupus@lettere.unipd.it> 
		    * grep -- I just wrote it.  Only matches simple strings
		    * ps -- I just wrote it.  Has _no_ options at all, but works.
		    * fsck_minix, mkfs_minix -- added from util-linux, but I ripped out
			internationalization and such to make them smaller.
		    * sfdisk -- Added from util-linux (minus internationalization and such).
	    * Probably some other changes that I forgot to document...
