config CONFIG_ASH
	bool "ash"
	default y
	help
	  Tha 'ash' shell adds about 60k in the default configuration and is
	  the most complete and most pedantically correct shell included with
	  busybox.  This shell is actually a derivative of the Debian 'dash'
	  shell (by Herbert Xu), which was created by porting the 'ash' shell
	  (written by Kenneth Almquist) from NetBSD.

	  Enable job control in the ash shell.

config CONFIG_ASH_ALIAS
	bool "  Enable alias support"

	  Enable alias support in the ash shell.

config CONFIG_ASH_MATH_SUPPORT
	bool "  Enable Posix math support"

	  Enable math support in the ash shell.

config CONFIG_ASH_GETOPTS
	bool "  Enable getopt builtin to parse positional parameters"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable builtin getopt in the ash shell.

config CONFIG_ASH_CMDCMD
	bool "  Enable cmdcmd to override shell builtins"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable support for the ash 'command' builtin, which allows
	  you to run the specified command with the specified arguments,
	  even when there is an ash builtin command with the same name.

config CONFIG_ASH_MAIL
	bool "  Check for new mail on interactive shells"
	default y
	depends on CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable "check for new mail" in the ash shell.

config CONFIG_ASH_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "  Optimize for size instead of speed"
	default y
	depends on CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Compile ash for reduced size at price of speed.

config CONFIG_HUSH
	bool "hush"
	default n
	help
	  hush is a very small shell (just 18k) and it has fairly complete
	  Bourne shell grammar.  It even handles all the normal flow control
	  options such as if/then/elif/else/fi, for/in/do/done, while loops,
	  etc.

	  It does not handle case/esac, select, function, here documents ( <<
	  word ), arithmetic expansion, aliases, brace expansion, tilde
	  expansion, &> and >& redirection of stdout+stderr, etc.


config CONFIG_LASH
	bool "lash"
	default n
	help
	  lash is the very smallest shell (adds just 10k) and it is quite
	  usable as a command prompt, but it is not suitable for any but the
	  most trivial scripting (such as an initrd that calls insmod a few
	  times) since it does not understand any Bourne shell grammar.  It
	  does handle pipes, redirects, and job control though.  Adding in
	  command editing makes it a very nice lightweight command prompt.


config CONFIG_MSH
	bool "msh"
	default n
	help
	  The minix shell (adds just 30k) is quite complete and handles things
	  like for/do/done, case/esac and all the things you expect a Bourne
	  shell to do.  It is not always pedantically correct about Bourne
	  shell grammar (try running the shell testscript "tests/sh.testcases"
	  on it and compare vs bash) but for most things it works quite well.
	  It also uses only vfork, so it can be used on uClinux systems.
