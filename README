BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The utilities in BusyBox
generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very
much like their GNU counterparts.

BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc, and a Linux kernel.
BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded
system.

BusyBox is extremely configurable.  This allows you to include only the
components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or
'make menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable.

After the build is complete, a busybox.links file is generated.  This is
used by 'make install' to create symlinks to the BusyBox binary for all
compiled in functions.  By default, 'make install' will place the symlink
forest into `pwd`/_install unless you have defined the PREFIX environment
variable (i.e., 'make PREFIX=/tmp/foo install')

If you wish to install hard links, rather than symlinks, you can use
'make PREFIX=/tmp/foo install-hardlinks' instead.

----------------

Supported architectures:

   BusyBox in general will build on any architecture supported by gcc.  It has
   a few specialized features added for __sparc__ and __alpha__.  insmod
   functionality is currently limited to x86, ARM, SH3/4, powerpc, m68k,
   MIPS, cris, and v850e.

Supported C Libraries:

   glibc-2.0.x, glibc-2.1.x, glibc-2.2.x, glibc-2.3.x, uClibc.  People
   are looking at newlib and diet-libc, but consider them unsupported,
   untested, or worse.  Linux-libc5 is no longer supported -- you
   should probably use uClibc instead if you want a small C library.

Supported kernels:

   Full functionality requires Linux 2.2.x or better.  A large fraction of the
   code should run on just about anything.  While the current code is fairly
   Linux specific, it should be fairly easy to port the majority of the code
   to, say, FreeBSD or Solaris, or Mac OS X, or even Windows (if you are into
   that sort of thing).

Getting help:

When you find you need help, you can check out the BusyBox mailing list
archives at http://busybox.net/lists/busybox/ or even join
the mailing list if you are interested.

Bugs:

If you find bugs, please submit a detailed bug report to the BusyBox mailing
list at busybox@mail.busybox.net.  A well-written bug report should include a
transcript of a shell session that demonstrates the bad behavior and enables
anyone else to duplicate the bug on their own machine. The following is such
an example:

    To: busybox@mail.busybox.net
    From: diligent@testing.linux.org
    Subject: /bin/date doesn't work

    Package: BusyBox
    Version: 1.00

    When I execute BusyBox 'date' it produces unexpected results.
    With GNU date I get the following output:

	$ date
	Sat Mar 27 14:19:41 MST 2004

    But when I use BusyBox date I get this instead:

	$ date
	illegal instruction

    I am using Debian unstable, kernel version 2.4.25-vrs2 on a Netwinder,
    and the latest uClibc from CVS.  Thanks for the wonderful program!

Note the careful description and use of examples showing not only what BusyBox
does, but also a counter example showing what an equivalent GNU app does.  Bug
reports lacking such detail may never be fixed...  Thanks for understanding.
