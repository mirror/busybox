	  run-parts is an utility designed to run all the scripts in a directory.

	  It is useful to set up a directory like cron.daily, where you need to
	  execute all the scripts in that directory.

	  This implementation of run-parts doesn't accept long options, and
	  some features (like report mode) aren't implemented.

	  Unless you know that run-parts is used in some of your scripts
	  you can safely say N here.

config CONFIG_WHICH
