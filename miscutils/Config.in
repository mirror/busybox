	default n
	depends on HDPARM
	help
	  Enables the 'hdparm -U' option to un-register an IDE interface.

config FEATURE_HDPARM_HDIO_DRIVE_RESET
	bool "perform device reset (DANGEROUS)"
	default n
	depends on HDPARM
	help
	  Enables the 'hdparm -w' option to perform a device reset.

config MAKEDEVS
	bool "makedevs"
	default n
	help
	  'makedevs' is a utility used to create a batch of devices with
	  one command.
	  .
	  There are two choices for command line behaviour, the interface
	  as used by LEAF/Linux Router Project, or a device table file.
	  .
	  'leaf' is traditionally what busybox follows, it allows multiple
	  devices of a particluar type to be created per command.
	  e.g. /dev/hda[0-9]
	  Device properties are passed as command line arguments.
	  .
	  'table' reads device properties from a file or stdin, allowing
	  a batch of unrelated devices to be made with one command.
	  User/group names are allowed as an alternative to uid/gid.

choice
	prompt "Choose makedevs behaviour"
	depends on MAKEDEVS

config READAHEAD
	bool "readahead"
	default n
	depends on LFS
	help
	  Preload the files listed on the command line into RAM cache so that
	  subsequent reads on these files will not block on disk I/O.

	  This applet just calls the readahead(2) system call on each file.
	  It is mainly useful in system startup scripts to preload files
	  or executables before they are used.  When used at the right time
	  (in particular when a CPU boundprocess is running) it can
	  significantly speed up system startup.

	  As readahead(2) blocks until each file has been read, it is best to
	  run this applet as a background job.

config RUNLEVEL
	bool "runlevel"
	default n
	help
	  find the current and previous system runlevel.

	  This applet uses utmp but does not rely on busybox supporing
	  utmp on purpose. It is used by e.g. emdebian via /etc/init.d/rc.

	bool "fancy output"
	default y
	depends on TASKSET
	help
	  Add code for fancy output. This merely silences a compiler-warning
	  and adds about 135 Bytes. May be needed for machines with alot
	  of CPUs.

config TIME
	bool "time"
	default n
	help
	  The time command runs the specified program with the given arguments.
	  When the command finishes, time writes a message to standard output
	  giving timing statistics about this program run.

config WATCHDOG
	bool "watchdog"
	default n
	help
	  The watchdog utility is used with hardware or software watchdog
	  device drivers.  It opens the specified watchdog device special file
	  and periodically writes a magic character to the device.  If the
	  watchdog applet ever fails to write the magic character within a
	  certain amount of time, the watchdog device assumes the system has
	  hung, and will cause the hardware to reboot.
